Odin Recipes

This website consisting of recipes was built as part of the Odin Project Foundations: HTML Foundations lesson in order to implement the basics that I learned about HTML.

I learned how to set up an HTML page, create an index, link it to other pages, link images, and create lists - both ordered and unordered.
